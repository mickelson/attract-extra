All the shaders in this directory have been converted from various sources to work with Mame GLSL.
This also means that nearly all of them will work well with Attract Mode, and with a little editing, using the Lottes and Halation Layouts as examples, the settings can be exposed to Attract Mode.

All shaders should have their respective copyrights and creators inserted in the headers.
If there are any that need their copyright info updated, please let me know.
